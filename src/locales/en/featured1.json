    "paragraph1": "Traditional Thai massage is a comprehensive therapeutic system that's been refined over centuries in Thailand. Unlike Western massage performed on a table with oils, Thai massage takes place on a comfortable padded mat with you fully clothed in loose, comfortable clothing. I use my hands, thumbs, elbows, knees, and feet to apply rhythmic pressure along your body's energy lines (called 'sen' lines), combined with assisted stretching that resembles passive yoga.",
    "paragraph2": "As a therapist from Buriram with VTCT Level 3 certification and over two years of professional experience in Bedford, I bring authentic traditional techniques adapted to meet your individual health needs. Each session is tailored to address your specific concerns—whether that's chronic back pain, tight shoulders from desk work, restricted hip mobility, or stress-related tension. Thai massage works systematically through the whole body, releasing deep-seated tension, improving circulation, and restoring your body's natural balance and energy flow.",
