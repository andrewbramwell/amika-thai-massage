    "paragraph1": "Deep tissue massage is a specialised therapeutic technique designed to address chronic pain, persistent muscle tension, and deep-seated restrictions that haven't responded to lighter massage approaches. Unlike relaxation massage that works on surface muscles, deep tissue therapy uses slower, more deliberate strokes with focused pressure to access the deeper layers of muscle tissue and fascia—the connective tissue surrounding muscles. This intensive approach is particularly effective for chronic lower back pain, frozen shoulder, sports injuries, repetitive strain problems, and long-standing muscular issues.",
    "paragraph2": "Professionally certified in deep tissue techniques since January 2024, I understand how to apply therapeutic pressure safely and effectively—working with your body's tolerance whilst achieving genuine clinical results. This isn't about causing pain; it's about accessing deeper muscle layers to break down adhesions, release chronic holding patterns, and restore proper function. Many clients worry deep tissue will be unbearable, but when performed correctly by a qualified therapist, it should feel intense but relieving—productive discomfort, not damage. Communication is essential throughout the session, and I'll adjust pressure based on your feedback to ensure the treatment is both effective and manageable.",
