		"paragraph1": "Thai massage is a powerful therapeutic treatment for chronic pain, restricted mobility, and muscular tension. Using a combination of deep pressure, stretching, and joint mobilisation, I work systematically through your body to release tight muscles, improve circulation, and increase range of motion. This isn't a gentle spa treatment—it's clinical bodywork that delivers measurable results for clients dealing with health concerns.",

From office workers with neck and shoulder tension to athletes managing sports injuries, this versatile technique can be adapted to address your specific concerns.",

		"title": "Professional Deep Tissue Massage in Bedford",
		"paragraph1": "Deep tissue massage targets the deeper layers of muscle and connective tissue to address chronic pain, persistent tension, and restricted movement. Using slow, deliberate strokes and focused pressure, I work through adhesions and knots that cause discomfort and limit your mobility. This specialized technique is particularly effective for chronic lower back pain, frozen shoulder, repetitive strain injuries, and long-standing muscular problems that haven't responded to lighter massage approaches.",
		"paragraph2": "With professional certification in deep tissue techniques, I understand how to apply appropriate pressure safely and effectively—working with your body's tolerance whilst achieving therapeutic results. This isn't about causing pain; it's about accessing deeper muscle layers to release tension and restore function. Many clients find significant relief after just one session, with continued improvement through regular treatment.",

		"topper": "FAQs",
		"title": "Common Questions Regarding Amika Thai Massage & Wellness",
		"imageAlt": "Massage oils, towels and hot stones",
		"question1": "Do I need to book in advance?",
		"answer1": "Yes, I operate by appointment only to ensure you receive my full attention and the time slot that works best for you. Please book in advance through my online booking system or by phone. I recommend booking at least a few days ahead, especially for weekend appointments, though I'll always do my best to accommodate urgent needs.",
		"question2": "What is your cancellation policy?",
		"answer2": "I require 24 hours' notice for cancellations or rescheduling. This allows me to offer your appointment time to other clients who need treatment. Cancellations with less than 24 hours' notice may incur a cancellation fee. I understand emergencies happen and will work with you on a case-by-case basis.",
		"question3": "How long does a typical treatment last?",
		"answer3": "Sessions vary from 30 to 120 minutes depending on the treatment and your needs. Full-body treatments like Thai Massage are most effective with longer sessions (90-120 minutes), whilst targeted treatments can be shorter. Check our Services page for current pricing and duration options for each treatment type.",
		"question4": "How often should I book treatments?",
		"answer4": "This depends on your individual needs and goals. For chronic pain or specific injuries, weekly sessions initially often provide the best results. For general wellness and stress management, fortnightly or monthly treatments work well. After your first session, I'll recommend a treatment plan based on your body's response and what you're trying to achieve.",
		"question5": "Will the massage be painful?",
		"answer5": "Therapeutic massage should never be unbearable. Thai massage and Deep Tissue work can be intense as I access deeper muscle layers, but I'll always work within your comfort level. I check in regularly during treatment and adjust pressure based on your feedback."
