    "title": "Welcome to Professional Therapeutic Care in Bedford  ",
    "paragraph1": "I'm Amy, a fully qualified massage therapist from Buriram, Thailand, and I've made Bedford my home for the past 16 years. After working as a professional therapist in Bedford for over two years, I opened Amika Thai Massage & Wellness in October 2025 to create a dedicated space where authentic Thai healing traditions meet modern clinical standards.",
    "paragraph2": "My approach combines the ancient wisdom of traditional Thai massage with evidence-based therapeutic techniques. As a sole practitioner, I provide consistent, personalised care where I can build trusting relationships with clients and track their progress over time. My home studio is set up as a professional treatment space where I can provide safe, effective massage therapy in a clean, comfortable environment.",
    "paragraph3": "I hold VTCT Level 3 certification in Thai Massage, along with specialized qualifications in Deep Tissue, Pregnancy Massage, Lymphatic Drainage, Aromatherapy, and Hot Stone techniques. But qualifications are just the foundation—what drives me is seeing clients find genuine relief from pain, tension, and stress. I'm committed to changing lives through the power of therapeutic touch, one treatment at a time.",
    "paragraph4": "This is more than a business to me. It's my calling, my passion, and my contribution to Bedford's wellbeing. I invite you to experience the difference that professional, compassionate, evidence-based massage therapy can make in your life.",
